## 💡 Important Tips

### ✅ DO's:

-   Keep statistics short and impactful (e.g., "10,000+", not "Ten Thousand")
-   Use the recommended number of items (shown in the corner of each section)
-   Double-check spelling before saving
-   Test changes by visiting the homepage

### ❌ DON'Ts:

-   Don't use special characters in "Unique ID" (stick to letters and hyphens)
-   Don't add too many items (follow the "X / Y items" recommendation)
-   Don't forget to check the "Active" checkbox
-   Don't panic if something looks wrong - you can always edit it again!

---

## 🔍 Understanding the Interface

### Item Count Badges

In the corner of each section, you'll see colored badges:

-   **Green badge (4/4)**: Perfect! You have the recommended number
-   **Blue badge (2/4)**: You need to add more items
-   **Orange badge (6/4)**: You have too many items (consider removing some)

### Active Toggle

Every item has an "Active" checkbox:

-   ✅ **Checked:** Item is visible on website
-   ❌ **Unchecked:** Item is hidden (useful for seasonal content)

### Display Order

Numbers that control the order items appear:

-   **1** = First position
-   **2** = Second position
-   **3** = Third position
-   Lower numbers appear first!

-   Scroll down - sections are organized by type

### "I accidentally deleted something!"

-   Don't worry! You can always add it back
